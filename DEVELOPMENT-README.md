# Development Readme

This document is intended to give pointers on how to develop the charts in this repo.

# Prerequisite

Charts were mostly tested in the cloud. In order to keep the dependencies the 
same, we use Nix to pin the exact dependencies. We use Direnv to provide the 
local settings hooks

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install [Direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sect-multi-user-installation) using multi-user installation if possible
- Install nix-direnv

```bash
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA nix-direnv
```

# Environment setup

The project directory is structured as a monorepo folder of charts. The charts
subdir uses Rancher charts convention where you store all the chart version. 
For example `charts/geonode` have several subdirectories with names `v0.1.1`, 
`v0.2.1`, etc. Each of this subdirectories is a Helm chart.

The dependencies inside each Helm chart subdirectories is managed by a combination 
of `.envrc` file (Direnv's) and `shell.nix` file (Nix's shell environment). 
Direnv will allow your shell to execute `.envrc` file, whenever you are inside that directory.
Each chart directory might need a different Helm binary version or Kubectl or KinD.
This is managed and expressed by `.envrc` and `.env` file.

Direnv files, `.envrc` works cascadingly. In the root directory, there is a 
`.envrc`. In the sub chart, there can be `.envrc` that overrides the root directory.
If you need to override these values, create extra file called `.local.envrc` or `.env`.
This will be executed to override `.envrc` in that directory.

Nix-shell function `shell.nix` is used to express the dependencies we need to 
setup our tools. It is also called by Direnv when we enter root directory of 
this project.

To setup the environment at first time, run this in the root project directory:

```
direnv allow
```

It will also setup your shell.

# Chart lint

To lint the chart, we use [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) tools.

Chart testing works by comparing diff changes in the repo. So we need to provide 
which branch we are working on against. Normally you have `origin` and `upstream` 
in a git based workflow. If not, then you need to set your `upstream` remote accordingly.

Running

```
ct lint
```

Will do a lint by comparing the current branch with the current `main` branch 
in local repo. To override this behaviour, refer to the chart-testing docs and 
do override necessary in the `.envrc` or `.env` directory
